      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Jack Copeland During 1941, codebreaking at Bletchley Park was hindered
        by shortages of typists and unskilled staV. These shortages could have
        been easily rectiWed, but the codebreakers’ urgent requests were ignored
        by oYcials in Whitehall. Going over the heads of those in command at GC
        & CS, Turing and his co-signatories wrote directly to the Prime
        Minister, Winston Churchill. On receiving the letter Churchill minuted
        his Chief of StaV, General Ismay: ‘action this day Make sure they have
        all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this had been
        done.’1 It fell to Stuart Milner-Barry of Hut 6 to deliver the letter by
        hand to 10 Downing Street. In 1986, Milner-Barry recalled his trip to
        Whitehall: Why I was deputed to carry the letter to No. 10 I do not
        remember—at a guess, because I was the most readily expendable from the
        scene of action. What I do recall is arriving at Euston Station, hailing
        a taxi, and with a sense of total incredulity (can this really be
        happening?) inviting the driver to take me to 10 Downing Street. The
        taxi-driver never blinked an eyelid: without comment he directed himself
        to Whitehall. Arrived at the entrance to Downing Street, I was again
        surprised at the lack of formality: there was just a wooden barrier
        across the road, and one uniformed policeman who waved my driver on. At
        the door to No. 10 I paid oV the taxi, rang the bell, was courteously
        ushered in, explained that I had an urgent letter which I was anxious to
        deliver to the Prime Minister 1 Both the letter and Churchill’s minute
        appear in F. H. Hinsley et al., British Intelligence in the Second World
        War, vol. ii (London: Her Majesty’s Stationery OYce, 1981), appendix 3,
        pp. 655–7. A facsimile of Churchill’s minute appears on p. xiii of R.
        Erskine and M. Smith (eds.), Action This Day (London: Bantam, 2001). The
        letter and minute are in the Public Record OYce in Kew, Richmond, Surrey
        (document reference HW 1/155). They are Crown copyright and are

        <p>Dear Prime Minister,</p>
        <p>
          <span>Some</span> weeks ago you paid us the honour of a visit, and we
          believe that you regard our work as important. You will have seen
          that, thanks largely to the energy and foresight of Commander Travis,
          we have been well supplied with the ‘bombes’ for the breaking of the
          German Enigma codes. We think, however, that you ought to know that
          this work is being held up, and in some cases is not being done at
          all, principally because we cannot get suYcient staV to deal with it.
          Our reason for writing to you direct is that for months we have done
          everything that we possibly can through the normal channels, and that
          we despair of any early improvement without your intervention. No
          doubt in the long run these particular requirements will be met, but
          meanwhile still more precious months will have been wasted, and as our
          needs are continually expanding we see little hope of ever being
          adequately staVed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>We</span> realise that there is a tremendous demand for labour
          of all kinds and that its allocation is a matter of priorities. The
          trouble to our mind is that as we are a very small section with
          numerically trivial requirements it is very diYcult to bring home to
          the authorities Wnally responsible either the importance of what is
          done here or the urgent necessity of dealing promptly with our
          requests. At the same time we Wnd it hard to believe that it is really
          impossible to produce quickly the additional staV that we need, even
          if this meant interfering with the normal machinery of allocations.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="marge-left">We</span> do not wish to burden you with a
          detailed list of our diYculties, but the following are the bottlenecks
          which are causing us the most acute anxiety

      <h1>1. Breaking of Naval Enigma (Hut 8)</h1>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Owing to shortage of staV and the overworking of his present team the
        Hollerith section here under Mr Freeborn has had to stop working night
        shifts. The eVect of this is that the Wnding of the naval keys is being
        delayed at least twelve hours every day. In order to enable him to start
        night shifts again Freeborn needs immediately about twenty more
        untrained Grade III women clerks. To put himself in a really adequate
        position to deal with any likely demands he will want a good many more.

        <span></span>A further serious danger now threatening us is that some of
        the skilled male staV, both with the British Tabulating Company at
        Letchworth and in Freeborn’s section here, who have so far been exempt
        from military service, are now liable to be called up.

      <h1>2. Military and Air Force Enigma (Hut 6)</h1>
      <p class="text-justify">
        We are intercepting quite a substantial proportion of wireless traYc in
        the Middle East which cannot be picked up by our intercepting stations
        here. This contains among other things a good deal of new ‘Light Blue’
        intelligence. Owing to shortage of trained typists, however, and the
        fatigue of our present decoding staV, we cannot get all this traYc
        decoded. This has been the state of aVairs since May. Yet all that we
        need to put matters right is about twenty trained typists.

      <h1>3. Bombe testing, Hut 6 and Hut 8</h1>
      <p class="text-justify">
        In July we were promised that the testing of the ‘stories’ produced by
        the bombes would be taken over by the WRNS in the bombe hut and that
        suYcient WRNS would be provided for this purpose. It is now late in
        October and nothing has been done. We do not wish to stress this so
        strongly as the two preceding points, because it has not actually
        delayed us in delivering the goods. It has, however, meant that staV in
        Huts 6 and 8 who are needed for other jobs have had to do the testing
        themselves. We cannot help feeling that with a Service matter of this
        kind it should have been possible to detail a body of WRNS for this
        purpose, if suYciently urgent instructions had been sent to the right
        quarters.

        <span>Apart </span> altogether from staV matters, there are a number of
        other directions in which it seems to us that we have met with
        unnecessary impediments. It would take too long to set these out in
        full, and we realise that some of the matters involved are
        controversial. The cumulative eVect, however, has been to drive us to
        the conviction that the importance of the work is not being impressed
        with suYcient force upon those outside authorities with whom we have to
        deal.

        We have written this letter entirely on our own initiative. We do not
        know who or what is responsible for our diYculties, and most
        emphatically we do not want to be taken as criticising Commander Travis
        who has all along done his utmost to help us in every possible way. But
        if we are to do our job as well as it could and should be done it is
        absolutely vital that our wants, small as they are, should be promptly
        attended to. We have felt that we should be failing in
